Daylight savings time? No problem. The software on the Raspberry Pi that powers the clock takes care of resetting the time.

Family member in another town and you just want to see what time it is there? Easy. Tell Alexa to change the time to that city and watch in awe as this beautiful mechanical clock rotates the hands by itself to change to that time.
